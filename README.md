# Spotify API Tutorial

Demonstrates the use of the [Authorization Code with PKCE Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-pkce-flow) for the Spotify API.

You can follow the tutorial here: <https://wanghci.github.io/spotify-api-tutorial/>

The [spotify.js](js/spotify.js) file contains code from the official Spotify docs that has been separated into functions, for your convenience.

## Demo

The tutorial includes a [demo](https://wanghci.github.io/spotify-api-tutorial/demo/) of the concepts, which are separated into three pages: `index.html` for the login, a separate `landing.html` for the auth code, and then a `result.html` that accesses the Spotify API.
